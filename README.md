# jwt-claims-fhir
This is a trial implementation of the proposal to use [jwt claims for fhir](./jwt-claims-fhir.md)

## Use

### claims
Evaluate claims against a proposed action

    //claims made in javascript web token
    var scope_claims = ['Foo/12345'];
    var action_claims = ['read:Foo', 'read:Bar'];

    //scope and action to evaluate
    var scope = '*';
    var action = {op: 'read', type: 'Bar'};

    if (lib.claims.authorise
        .access(scope, scope_claims)
        .action(action, action_claims)
        .isAuthorised)
    {
        console.log('authorised');
    }

### parser
Determine action from a request with url and method

    var options = {
        base: 'https://fhir.example.net/svc/fhir'
    };

    var req = {
        url: 'https://fhir.example.net/svc/fhir/Foo/123',
        method: 'GET'
    };

    var action = lib.parser.parse(req, options);

    console.log(action);
